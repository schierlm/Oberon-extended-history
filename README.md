# The Extended Oberon operating system and the programming language Oberon-2 (2020 Edition)

This is an archive of older versions from [Extended Oberon](https://github.com/andreaspirklbauer/Oberon-extended).

Some versions were downloaded from [Software Heritage](https://softwareheritage.org/), some are from my private archives when I build Experimental Oberon disk images. The most recent ones are from GitHub's event feed which makes it possible to detect force-pushes and graft together their history.

The movie files as well as the disk images have been removed, and are instead available as an archive (containing all the different movie files/disk images)
in the Releases section.

Note that the disk image archive is a `7-Zip` archive containing uncompressed `tar` archives, as that way saves a lot of space (all the original .gz archives
have a few hundred Megabytes, uncompressed more than 9 Gigabytes, yet the recompressed archive is less than 8 Megabytes.)
