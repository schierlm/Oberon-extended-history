# Instructions for converting an existing Project Oberon 2013 system to Extended Oberon

If you run Oberon in an emulator on the desktop (e.g., http://github.com/pdewacht/oberon-risc-emu), you can simply backup your existing S3RISCinstall directory, download the compressed archive [**S3RISCinstall.tar.gz**](Documentation/S3RISCinstall.tar.gz) from this repository (containing Extended Oberon) to your emulator directory, run the command *tar xvzf S3RISCinstall.tar.gz* in that directory and then restart the emulator.
